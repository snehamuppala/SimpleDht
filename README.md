# SimpleDht
Designed a real time messaging application with multicast capability following simple DHT based on Chord for the course CSE 586: Distributed Systems offered in Spring 2019 at University at Buffalo under the prof. Steve Ko.

## Introduction

Designed and implemented a simple Distributed Hash Table based on Chord protocol. Although the design is based on Chord, it is a simplified version of Chord; did not implement finger tables and finger-based routing; not handle node leaves/failures. Therefore, there are three things we implemented : 
1) ID space partitioning/re-partitioning
2) Ring-based routing
3) Node joins
